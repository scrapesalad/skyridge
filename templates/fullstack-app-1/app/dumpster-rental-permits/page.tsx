          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            Most Utah municipalities require a temporary right-of-way permit when a roll-off
            dumpster blocks public property such as a street lane, alley, bike path, or sidewalk.
            Neighborhoods controlled by an HOA often require written approval even if the container
            stays completely on your driveway. Seasonal construction blitzes around Salt Lake City,
            Provo, Park City, and the Wasatch Back routinely trigger heightened enforcement, so we
            check restrictions before dispatching a driver. Our operations desk keeps a live notebook
            of each city&apos;s trigger points—setback distances, reflective tape rules, available
            placement windows, and whether safety cones must stay in place after sunset.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            Inside residential zones, permits are usually waived when a dumpster fits within your
            private property footprint and leaves sidewalks clear. That said, driveways that slope
            to the street or share an apron with a neighbor may still demand a barricade plan. Icon
            Dumpsters stakes boards, wheel chocks, and warning cones whenever the downhill pitch is
            greater than six percent so inspectors see a safe installation even without paperwork.

            City-by-City Highlights From Our Permit Log
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Salt Lake City:</strong> Public Services requires a Right of Way Use Permit if
            the dumpster touches asphalt. Approvals are typically issued within two business days
            once we submit a site sketch. Downtown projects must add Class II barricades or connect
            the container to an existing construction enclosure.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>South Jordan &amp; Herriman:</strong> HOA-driven neighborhoods like Daybreak and
            Rosecrest require including the HOA manager on the permit request. We send them photos of
            the intended placement and promise daily check-ins when the container is visible from the
            community trail system.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Park City:</strong> Historic Main Street projects must coordinate with the
            Building Department. Permits are limited to specific delivery windows (before 9 a.m. or
            after 6 p.m.) and we position amber beacons on every container parked near visitor
            parking stalls.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Provo &amp; Orem:</strong> The two cities share the same permit application, but
            Provo insists on reflective striping while Orem focuses on insurance certificates. We
            keep both on file with blanket coverage up to $5 million so your job is never delayed.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-900">Our Permit Support Workflow</h2>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            1. During scheduling we ask whether your container will sit on private ground, in a road
            lane, or along a shoulder. If anything touches the public right-of-way we immediately
            open a permit ticket in our dispatch system and attach your site map or photographs.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            2. We contact the municipal office or HOA with jurisdiction, confirm the latest fees,
            and file the paperwork digitally. Many cities in the Wasatch Front now use online
            portals—we maintain logins for Salt Lake City, Sandy, West Valley City, Park City,
            Midvale, and more to keep submittals under 15 minutes.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            3. While waiting for approval we plan staging so the container can rest inside your
            property until the permitted window opens. Our drivers can return at specific hours to
            shift the dumpster curbside once inspectors sign off.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            4. After delivery we photograph the setup, showing barricades, cones, or lighting the
            city requires. Those images stay on file in case you or the municipality needs
            documentation that the site remained safe for pedestrians.
          </p>

            Fees, Timelines &amp; Insurance Considerations
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            Permit costs range from $15 to $120 depending on the city and how long the container
            stays in place. Utah County jurisdictions often base fees on daily occupancy, while Salt
            Lake County assesses a flat charge for seven calendar days. Icon Dumpsters pays the city
            directly and passes the exact amount through on your invoice with scanned receipts so you
            never guess what the municipality charged.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            Proof of liability insurance and workers&apos; compensation coverage is mandatory in
            virtually every permit packet. We maintain active certificates listing each city, county,
            and school district we serve, and we can add homeowners associations or general
            contractors as additionally insured within one business hour. If your project requires a
            bond or lane closure plan, we coordinate with trusted traffic-control vendors and
            deliver the combined package back to the city on your behalf.

            Permit Tips From Our Dispatch Desk
          </h2>
          <ul className="mt-4 list-disc space-y-3 pl-6 leading-relaxed">
            <li>
              Apply as soon as you know a dumpster must sit on the street. Even responsive cities
              such as Bountiful and Layton still need 24–48 hours to route approvals through public
              works, police, or fire.
            </li>
            <li>
              Measure your staging area carefully. Cities deny permits when the container would block
              fire hydrants, mailboxes, or ADA ramps. Provide distances and we will choose the best
              roll-off size for the remaining clearance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Watch weekend and holiday schedules. Many town halls close on Fridays and federal
              holidays, so Thursday afternoon submissions may not be reviewed until Monday.
            </li>
            <li>
              Budget time to renew. Multi-week remodels often require extending the permit; we alert
              you two days before expiration and can renew automatically if you confirm via text.
            </li>
          </ul>

            How Icon Dumpsters Keeps Compliance Simple
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            Our local permitting specialists monitor regulation updates every quarter and attend
            municipal meetings when major changes surface. We maintain an internal database that
            flags which neighborhoods require steel plates under the container, which ones prefer
            reflective webbing versus barricades, and which demand on-site contact numbers. When you
            schedule a dumpster, we double-check the address against that database and send a
            personalized checklist so you know exactly what to expect.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            If a compliance officer visits your site, our office is available seven days a week to
            provide paperwork, reroute drivers, or swap you into a smaller container. We would rather
            reposition the roll-off than risk a citation, and most adjustments happen the same day
            you call. Together we keep your project moving, protect public infrastructure, and give
            nearby residents confidence that the cleanup is being handled by professionals.
