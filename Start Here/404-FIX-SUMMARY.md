## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Logo Image Path Errors** (75 files)

**Issue**: Pages referenced `logo.png` which doesn't exist. The correct file is `pondcleanuplogo.png` in the `images/logo/` directory.

**Files Affected**:
- 71 city pages: `pages/cities/*.html`
- 2 contractor pages: `pages/contractor/*.html`
- 2 main pages: `find-a-contractor.html`, `for-contractors.html`

**Fix Applied**:
```
Old: ../../images/logo.png
New: ../../images/logo/pondcleanuplogo.png

Old: ../images/logo.png
New: ../images/logo/pondcleanuplogo.png
```

### 2. **Missing Contractor Pages** (4 broken links)

**Issue**: `find-a-contractor.html` linked to 4 contractor profile pages that didn't exist:
- `contractor/mountain-pond-solutions.html`
- `contractor/rocky-mountain-waterworks.html`
- `contractor/clearwater-pond-care.html`
- `contractor/aquatic-designs-co.html`

**Fix Applied**:
Removed the 4 non-existent contractor cards from the listing page. The page now displays only the 2 actual contractor profiles:
- ✅ Bluewater Pond Garden
- ✅ Utah Service Areas
