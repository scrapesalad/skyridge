Template 1: kingtut-classic – Service Business (you already have)

Style:

Standard header with logo left, nav right, CTA button.

Two-column hero (text left, image right).

“How it works” 4-step row.

Services grid, testimonials, gallery, CTA.

This is already very Avada-ish. Just refactor your placeholders to tokens (as in previous message).

Template 2: corporate-split – Split-screen hero, icon boxes, alternating bands

Avada-style design cues:

Hero: full-height split screen (left: solid/gradient background & text; right: image or mockup).

Sticky / boxed header with subtle shadow.

Service icons in a 3- or 4-column “icon box” section.

Alternating sections: image-left/text-right, then image-right/text-left.

Big stats strip with counters (e.g. “500+ projects”, “10+ years”)

Template 3: onepage-parallax – Single-page scrolling, parallax & anchor nav

Avada-ish vibe:

One-page layout with header nav linking to sections (#services, #about, #projects, #contact).

Full-screen hero with parallax background.

Large, full-width color “bands” for each section.

“Pricing” or “Packages” section with 3–4 pricing cards.

Bottom contact form & map embed.

Key differences vs Template 1 & 2:

Navigation uses internal anchors.

No separate pages; everything is on index.html.

Visual emphasis on parallax backgrounds and big bands.

Template 4: portfolio-grid – Masonry grid, case studies, filters

Avada-ish vibe:

Hero is smaller, more “agency/portfolio” oriented.

Big filterable grid of projects (“All / Residential / Commercial” tabs).

Each project card opens a project detail page or a modal.

Minimal, clean, lots of white space, large thumbnails.

Testimonials as a slider instead of a grid.

Make sure:

Header looks more minimal (logo + inline nav, smaller CTA).

Home page is project-heavy, not services-heavy.

Template 5: agency-modern – Full-width slider, overlapping cards, diagonal bands

Avada-ish vibe:

Full-width hero with carousel/slider (you can plug in Swiper/Glide later).

Overlapping cards on the hero bottom (e.g. “Free Quote”, “24/7 Support”, “Local Experts”).

Diagonal/angled section backgrounds using pseudo-elements or SVG.

Strong typographic hierarchy and lots of card components.

Contact form widget in the sidebar or sticky panel.

This one should feel like a completely different “demo” from the classic service theme.
