# Stock Images Directory

This directory contains stock images organized by vertical/niche.

## Structure

Each vertical folder (e.g., `landscaping/`, `roofing/`) should contain:
- Hero images
- Gallery/project images
- Service-specific images

## Usage

When a user selects a vertical during site generation, images from the corresponding folder are automatically copied to `images/stock/` in the generated site.

## Adding Images

1. Add images to the appropriate vertical folder
2. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `landscaping-hero-1.jpg`, `roofing-project-1.png`)
3. Ensure images are optimized for web (compressed, appropriate dimensions)
4. Only include images you have rights to use

## Image Sources

- Use royalty-free stock images
- Ensure proper licensing
- Consider using services like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay
- Or use images from the user's existing site (via wget option)

## Template References

Templates reference images like:
- `images/stock/hero-1.jpg`
- `images/stock/gallery-1.png`

Make sure your images match these naming conventions or update template references.
